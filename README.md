# jekyll-homepage

Plugins and templates for my homepage.

## About

My homepage is based on Drupal. But Drupal has a lot of functionality
and overhead, which I don't use or need.

I already extract the static pages with wget and put them on my
webspace. Therefore, the next natural step is using a static generator
like Jekyll.

This is the perfect opportunity to learn how to use Jekyll and polish
my Ruby skills.

## Plugins and filters

The features I needed were a sidebar with a monthly archive and a tag
archive. I also wanted monthly and tag archive pages. Finally, I added
some filters and a template for a files section at the end of some of
my pages.
